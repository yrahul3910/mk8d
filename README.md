# Style Guide

## General

We use [ruff](https://beta.ruff.rs) for linting. You can find the code style in `pyproject.toml`.

## Pre-commit Hooks

We use `pre-commit` for code quality checks. Use `pre-commit install` to install the hooks. Then, you can run them with
`pre-commmit run --all-files`.

**Important:** After cloning the project, run `pre-commit install` first.
